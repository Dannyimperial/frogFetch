Welcome to frogFetch! 

A terminal program with tools designed for terminal customization.
This initial release will only contain one tool: the “Pixel to ASCII” tool.
The primary goal of this tool set is simplicity and user-friendliness.
This should be considered a “testing release” and not the final product. Many more features and tools
still need to be implemented.

**Works with:**
+ .PNG

**Required:**
+ javac (for compiling)
+ jdk (for executing)
+ neofetch (to view the result)

All images have to be placed incide main directory. 

In order to view compiled ASCII images you have to use [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch).
+ Navigate to line `image_source=`, and change the path to yours.
Example:
``` 
image_source="~/Downloads/frogFetch/frog.txt"
```
+ Change the gap size number to at least `-394` in order to correctly see ascii with system specs.
