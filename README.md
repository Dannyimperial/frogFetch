Welcome to frogFetch! A terminal program with tools designed for terminal customization.
This initial release will only contain one tool: the “Pixel to ASCII” tool.
The primary goal of this tool set is simplicity and user-friendliness.
This should be considered a “testing release” and not the final product. Many more features and tools
still need to be implemented.

This program is written in Java. In order to run it, you will need to install the Java Development Kit
(JDK).

The frogFetch.java program requires certain folders to be present in the same directory: "frogs", "toads", and ".tadpoles"
These are all in the tar.gz file as well as a detailed guide for how to use the program.
